## MMES Cohort 2024 Capstone: Biofouling

Biofoul are sessile marine animals that grow on top of submerged structures. Tropical biofouling community succession is underresearched in the Caribbean. My cohort and I researched taxon-level early stage biofouling communities across the southern side of St. Thomas.

We are currently in the process of submitting our original research. I aided in creating a map of the watershed characteristics of St. Thomas, USVI and our site locations (Fig 1.).

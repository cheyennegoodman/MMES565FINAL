Goodman\n\n\nMy site location is Brewers Bay, east of the Territorial Coral Reef Monitoring Program (TCRMP) site.. I have 18 Orbicella annularis plots: 6 damselfish-free control plots, 6 damselfish infested Orbicella annularis plots, and 6 Orbicella annularis plots where damselfish is removed.\nWeekly, two to three divers will dive (&lt;25ft) at Brewers Bay (Figure No. 2) to complete a short coral health survey, fish survey and collect fish. One diver will be collecting data by scanning each 1m^2 plot with an underwater camera. Once PASTs nubbins are deployed, the experiment will end at 10 weeks.\nPhotogrammetry will be used on Agisoft Professional to look at coral growth and predation marks.\n\n\n\nFigure No. 2.

Coral nubbins will be equally divided between ambient water temperature ~28 C and heated water temperature (~32C).\nDue to the recent renovations in the Marine Science Center parking lot in July 2025, I created an altered water table design which required &gt;3 daily water changes. Three methods of shading was applied and neither water tables recieved flow. A hobologger was placed in each water table to record temperature every hour. See statistical analysis to view the results of this water table design."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe Caribbean is home to 10% of the global coral cover, yet over 75% of Caribbean corals are considered threatened (UNEP-WCMC et al., 2021; Burke et al., 2011). Both global and local stressors such as disease and thermal stress has caused massive die-offs in corals and other ecologically important species such as Diadema antillarum ; therefore, causing an increase in macroalgae (Jackson et al., 2014). Figure No. 1 shows a reef building stony coral, Orbicella annularis that provides shelter and structure to reef fish.\n Native to the Caribbean, there are eight species of damselfish that range from herbivore and planktivores. These fish have aggressive behavior that causes them to defend their territories and bite coral to create algal gardens for food (Kaufman, 1981)."

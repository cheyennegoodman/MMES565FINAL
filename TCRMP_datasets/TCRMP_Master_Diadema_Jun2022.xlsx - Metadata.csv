Columns,
Location,Monitoring location at which data was collected
SampleDate,Date on which data was collected
SampleYear,Monitoring period in which data was collected; Note - Sample year may not always match the year from the SampleDate if a location was surveyed late in the annual monitoring period (i.e. data collected in January 2018 could be included in the 2017 annual monitoring period)
SampleMonth,"Month in which data was collected; Note - when a location was not surveyed fully in the same month, the month in which sampling began is used as the sample month"
Period,"Refers to the sample period in which the data falls; Periods are as follows: Annual (normal annual TCRMP sampling), PeakBL (secondary TCRMP sampling to capture peak bleaching due to thermal stress), PostBL (secondary sampling as a follow up to thermal stress), PostHurr (seconday sampling after the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria), SCTLD (extra sampling points taken at a subsample of TCRMP locations to monitor the progression of Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease), and WS (samples taken at a subset of TCRMP locations [Black Point, Buck Island STT, Coculus Rock, Magens Bay, Botany Bay, Savana, Flat Cay, Seahorse Cottage Shoal] during research cruises aboard the R/V Walton Smith)"
Recorder,Diver who recorded the data
Transect,Transect number
TransSize,Indicates the survey transect area
NoDiad,Number of Diadema antillarum recorded within the transect survey area
DiadDens,Density of Diadema antillarum per 100 m2
TestSize,Estimated test size in cm of Diadema antillarum recorded within the transect survey area
Notes,Additional notes about the transect

Other Notes,
1,"There are typically 6 (2002-2008), 10 (2009-2018), or 9 (2019-pres) replicate transects completed per site though additional transects may have been completed. Sampling points with fewer than the appropriate number of replicates for the time period indicates those transects were not completed"
2,"From 2002-2007, the survey area of transects was 20 m2. From 2008 to present the survey area was increased to 50 m2"
3,Ginsburg Fringe has variable numbers of transects completed since its addition to the monitoring program due to logistical difficulties in fully sampling the site

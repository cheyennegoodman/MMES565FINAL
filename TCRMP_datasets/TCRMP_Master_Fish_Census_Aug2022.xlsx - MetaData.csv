Columns,
Location,Monitoring location at which data was collected
Year,Year in which data was collected
Month,"Month in which data was collected; Note - when a location was not surveyed fully in the same month, the month in which sampling began is used as the sample month"
SampleYear,"Monitoring period in which data was collected; Note - Sample year may not always match ""Year"" if a location was surveyed late in the annual monitoring period (i.e. data collected in January 2018 could be included in the 2017 annual monitoring period)"
Period,"Refers to the sample period in which the data falls; Periods are as follows: Annual (normal annual TCRMP sampling), PeakBL (secondary TCRMP sampling to capture peak bleaching due to thermal stress), PostBL (secondary sampling as a follow up to thermal stress), SCTLD (extra sampling points taken at a subsample of TCRMP locations to monitor the progression of Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease), and WS (samples taken at a subset of TCRMP locations [Black Point, Buck Island STT, Coculus Rock, Magens Bay, Botany Bay, Savana, Flat Cay, Seahorse Cottage Shoal] during research cruises aboard the R/V Walton Smith); Note that fish census did not occur during all sample periods"
Transect,Transect number
ScientificName,Identifies the species observed by its scientific name
SizeClass,Identifies the size class in which observed species fell. All size classes are in cm
Count/Biomass,Count of the total number of individuals of each species observed in each size class or total biomass of individuals of each species observed in each size class

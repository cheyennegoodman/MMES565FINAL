## Background data

I am reviewing the Territorial Coral Reef Monitoring Program (TCRMP) dataset from 2013-2021 to investigate damselfish biomass and abundance. See statistical analysis to view the damselfish population trends between 2012-2021.

I hope to get a hold of DPNR's dataset of damselfish predation to fill in gaps that TCRMP has. For example, not every diver knows/ records damselfish species during their coral health surveys to make an accurate depiction of damselfish-coral interaction.

## Water Table Methods

Two 40gal water tables contain 48 *Porites astreoides* coral nubbins for ten days. 36 coral nubbins will be deployed in randomly across the 18 plots with one bleached and one unbleached coral in each plot.

Twelve *Porites astreoides* (PAST) from Brewers Bay at relative depth (15-20ft) will be fragmented into \~5cm coral nubbins (n=48). Coral nubbins will be equally divided between ambient water temperature \~28 C and heated water temperature (\~32C).

Due to the recent renovations in the Marine Science Center parking lot in July 2025, I created an altered water table design which required \>3 daily water changes. Three methods of shading was applied and neither water tables recieved flow. A hobologger was placed in each water table to record temperature every hour. See statistical analysis to view the results of this water table design.

## Field Methods

My site location is Brewers Bay, east of the Territorial Coral Reef Monitoring Program (TCRMP) site.. I have 18 *Orbicella annularis* plots: 6 damselfish-free control plots, 6 damselfish infested *Orbicella annularis* plots, and 6 *Orbicella annularis* plots where damselfish is removed.

Weekly, two to three divers will dive (\<25ft) at Brewers Bay (Figure No. 2) to complete a short coral health survey, fish survey and collect fish. One diver will be collecting data by scanning each 1m\^2 plot with an underwater camera. Once PASTs nubbins are deployed, the experiment will end at 10 weeks.

Photogrammetry will be used on Agisoft Professional to look at coral growth and predation marks.

### Damselfish Collection

All species of damselfish are required to be removed from designated plots. They are to be released to Perseverance Bay after capture.

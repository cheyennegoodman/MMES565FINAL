## Introduction

The Caribbean is home to 10% of the global coral cover, yet over 75% of Caribbean corals are considered threatened (UNEP-WCMC et al., 2021; Burke et al., 2011). Both global and local stressors such as disease and thermal stress has caused massive die-offs in corals and other ecologically important species such as *Diadema antillarum *; therefore, causing an increase in macroalgae (Jackson et al., 2014). Figure No. 1 shows a reef building stony coral, *Orbicella annularis* that provides shelter and structure to reef fish.

Native to the Caribbean, there are eight species of damselfish that range from herbivore and planktivores. These fish have aggressive behavior that causes them to defend their territories and bite coral to create algal gardens for food (Kaufman, 1981). 

## Research Objectives

I aim to answer these questions with my research thesis:

-   Does damselfish presence through predation bites and algal gardens truly negatively impact coral growth?

-   How does damselfish presence and algal gardens negatively impact the recovery of corals after thermal stress?

-   How has damselfish presence correlated to coral health, disease, and bleaching recovery within the past 10 years?
